# JSskillstracker
## Idea outline
Skills tracker for Javascript. Possibly a wagon wheel. Twelveish skills, each one on a different spoke, with the spoke sub-divided into three segments growing more difficult as you go further out. Progress along a spoke is unlocked my completing curated Codewars kata. Users track their progress both clockwise and outwards. Sign in with Github.

## Why
* Gives beginners a place to start and gives them a progression of things to work on
* Lets more experienced users see where they might be weak, need to practice

## Considerations
* Keep it as simple as possible
* Talk about a problem you're familiar with
* Aim to complete within roughly a month 04/04/2016
